# üéØ HackNotts Project Context

## Project Overview
This is a HackNotts CLI project - an advanced AI-powered command-line interface tool that helps developers interact with multiple AI providers seamlessly. The CLI supports real-time chat, provider management, and export functionality.

## Technology Stack
- Language: TypeScript
- Framework: React (Ink for CLI)
- Key Libraries: 
  - Ink - React for CLI
  - Vitest - Testing framework
  - tsdown - Build tool
  - Multiple AI provider SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

## Project Goals
1. Provide a unified interface for multiple AI providers
2. Enable seamless switching between different AI models
3. Support chat history export and session management
4. Offer extensible plugin system for custom functionality

## Current Status
### Completed
- ‚úÖ Core CLI framework with Ink
- ‚úÖ Multiple AI provider integration
- ‚úÖ Command system (help, exit, clear, export, model, cd, init)
- ‚úÖ Provider dashboard
- ‚úÖ Chat interface with history
- ‚úÖ Init command for project context
- ‚úÖ Automatic HACKNOTTS.md context detection and injection

### In Progress
- üîÑ Testing coverage
- üîÑ Documentation improvements

### TODO
- ‚è≥ Additional AI providers
- ‚è≥ Plugin system enhancements
- ‚è≥ Configuration file support

## Important Notes
- The CLI uses a modular architecture with separate packages for aiCore, cli, and toolkit
- Commands are registered dynamically through the CommandRegistry system
- The HACKNOTTS.md file is **automatically detected** and injected as context in conversations
- Context is loaded at startup and when changing directories with `/cd`
- Context is invisibly added to the first message of each conversation
- Users don't see the context in chat history, but AI assistants can access it
