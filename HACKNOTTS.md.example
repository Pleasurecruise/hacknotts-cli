- Framework: React (Ink for CLI)
- Key Libraries: 
  - Ink - React for CLI
  - Vitest - Testing framework
  - tsdown - Build tool
  - Multiple AI provider SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

## Project Goals
1. Provide a unified interface for multiple AI providers
2. Enable seamless switching between different AI models
3. Support chat history export and session management
4. Offer extensible plugin system for custom functionality

## Current Status
### Completed
